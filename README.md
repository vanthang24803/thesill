## Running locally

  

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Thesill Commerce. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

  

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control your Thesill store.
